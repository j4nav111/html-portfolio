<h1>The Best Movies According to Janavi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite movies/genres of all time!!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Scary Movie(All the sequels!)</h3>
<p>These movies are paradoies of the original horror movies. They are extremely funny to watch and always know how to lighten up your mood after a bad day.</p>
<h3>2. Any old bollywood movie(2000s-2015)</h3>
<p>These movies are heart warming and always end with a deep life lesson or a valuable lesson like, "We only live once.." or "Family is important".<br />They are very emotional, a few examples are 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai', 'YJHD', 'ZNMD', etc.</p>
<h3>Horror Movies</h3>
<p>I get extremely scared watching them but yet they are very fun to watch. Any horror movie is a good horror movie especially a one with sequels.</p>
